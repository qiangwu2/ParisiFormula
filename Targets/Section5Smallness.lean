# A common positive accuracy for Section 5

Continuity at zero supplies a positive near-optimality tolerance satisfying
both the sixth-root curvature condition and the square-root far-overlap
condition. Its choice depends only on beta and the terminal time, not the
scheme, physical level, overlap, system size or disorder.
