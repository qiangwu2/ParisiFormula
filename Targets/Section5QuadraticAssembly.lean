# Converting regional deficits to one quadratic bound

This file contains the elementary last step used after the local and compact
Section 5 estimates have been assembled.  It is deliberately abstract in the
finite-size/disorder variables: no continuity of the constrained free energy
or of the attainable-overlap set is needed.  The regional hypotheses must be
proved separately from Talagrand's interpolation argument.

/-- If a deficit is quadratic near `q` and uniformly positive away from `q`,
then it is bounded below by one quadratic function on `[-1,1]`.  The constant
`4 / c` uses only `|u-q| ≤ 2`; the statement is independent of all auxiliary
parameters such as system size and disorder. -/
