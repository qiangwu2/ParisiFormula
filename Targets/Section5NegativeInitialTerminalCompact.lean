# Compact signed terminal interval at the first physical level

The positive-time signed comparison and the time-zero stationary lambda gain
remain valid after redundant terminal padding.  This supplies the compact
version of the last negative trial interval without assuming that the padded
scheme is itself a fixed-level minimizer.
