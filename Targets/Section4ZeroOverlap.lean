# Scalar identities at a zero initial overlap

When `q₁ = 0`, both initial variances vanish. The genuine normalized
squared-slope and squared-Hessian factors are therefore scalar squares.
Fixed-level stationarity forces the scalar first derivative to vanish.
The second-order one-sided optimality estimate is a separate obligation;
these identities do not assert its curvature conclusion.
