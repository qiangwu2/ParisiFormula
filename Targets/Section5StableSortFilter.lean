# Stable sorting and deletion of a tagged zero-variance entry

The adjacent-trial gluing uses stable sorting on tagged entries.  Removing a
particular tag after sorting is the same as removing it before sorting.  This
is an exact list identity: equal sorting keys are allowed, because tags are
distinct and the non-strict sorting relation is antisymmetric on the tagged
entries themselves.
