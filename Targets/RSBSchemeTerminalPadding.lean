# Redundant terminal mass-one padding

Appending mass one at overlap one adds a zero-variance innermost scalar
step. The original physical masses and overlaps are unchanged, and the
scalar recursion is merely shifted by one level. No minimality of the
padded scheme is asserted or needed for the terminal factor adapters.
