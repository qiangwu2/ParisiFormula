# Breakpoint-safe trial intervals outside the neighboring overlap range

The left regime uses half-open intervals `[q_(j-1),q_j)`, whereas the right
regime uses `(q_(j-1),q_j]`. First-crossing selection therefore includes exact
breakpoint overlaps, repeated overlaps, and zero initial overlaps. The trial
index never exceeds `k + 1`; no extension to the final interval is asserted.
