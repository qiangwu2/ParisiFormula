# Compact terminal trial interval after redundant padding

The final trial interval is represented by the redundant mass-one padding.
The generic compact witness argument applies to the padded scheme (whose last
trial index is now admissible); the exact cascade and Guerra-function
identities then transport the resulting bound back to the original scheme.
The lower endpoint is kept open because the adjacent breakpoint belongs to
the preceding trial interval.

/-- Uniform strictness on the terminal trial interval.  Only the original
